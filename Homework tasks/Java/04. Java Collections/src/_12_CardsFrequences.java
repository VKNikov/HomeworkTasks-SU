//Problem 12. Cards Frequencies
//We are given a sequence of N playing cards from a standard deck. The input consists of several cards (face + suit), separated by a space. 
//Write a program to calculate and print at the console the frequency of each card face in format "card_face -> frequency". The frequency is calculated by the formula appearances / N and is expressed 
//in percentages with exactly 2 digits after the decimal point. The card faces with their frequency should be printed in the order of the card face's first appearance in the input. 
//The same card can appear multiple times in the input, but it's face should be listed only once in the output.
