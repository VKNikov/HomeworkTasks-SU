/*Problem 4. ** Full House with Jokers
In most Poker games, the "full house" hand is defined as three cards of the same face + two cards of the same face, other than the first, regardless of the card's suits. The cards faces are "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K" and "A". The card suits are "♣", "♦", "♥" and "♠". A special card "Joker" (denoted as "*") is used as wildcard and can replace any other card. Jokers do not have a suite. Jokes can be used several times in a hand. Write a program to generate and print all full houses and print their number.
